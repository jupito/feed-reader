feed-reader
===========

Simplistic single-user feed reader for web browser. Uses Python, SQLite, CGI.

I wrote most of this while still learning Python, so the code is messy and kind
of stupid. Will be renovated.

Todo:
- Better lock handling.
- Web UI for database management.
- Proper authentication.
- HTML templating.
